    Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy 
    film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

    Explanation :
    
    Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses paranormal powers that allow
     her to control and create ice and snow, often using it to play with
      her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic,
       their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by
        Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa's
        magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. He also states that 
        fear will be Elsa's greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the
         castle. Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to control it, 
         Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to become more insecure. When the
          sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.
    
    When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle.
    She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about
     her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and

        falls in love with at first sight. Elsa's coronation happens without a
         hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna,
          Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court; the Duke
           brands her a monster. Elsa flees to the North Mountain,
            where she builds a palace of ice in which to live a hermit life.
             In the process however, her suppressed
              magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winte
